"This project, 'Plant Growth Stages with Environmental and Management Data using Power BI,' aims to provide a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of plant development. By integrating environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and sunlight with management practices such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, we can visualize and analyze how these variables influence each stage of plant growth. Utilizing Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities, we will create interactive dashboards that reveal key trends, correlations, and potential optimization strategies. This will enable users, from farmers to researchers, to gain actionable insights for improved crop yields, resource efficiency, and overall plant health, ultimately fostering more sustainable and productive agricultural practices."
